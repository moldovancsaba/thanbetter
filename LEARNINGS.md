# Development Learnings

## OAuth Development Environment Configuration (2025-07-07T15:36:49Z)

### Critical Findings
- OAuth callback URLs must use consistent ports throughout the authentication flow
- Development environment requires special handling for dynamic ports
- Hardcoded URLs in any part of the OAuth flow can break the entire authentication process

### Best Practices
- Always use dynamic URL resolution in development environment
- Maintain a single source of truth for environment-specific URLs
- Implement proper environment detection and configuration inheritance
- Use automated scripts to manage OAuth client configuration

### Technical Solutions
- Centralize URL configuration management
- Implement request-based dynamic port detection
- Use environment-aware routing throughout the application
- Ensure OAuth client database entries match the development environment

### Critical Findings
- Module import/export consistency is crucial for build reliability
- Mixed module patterns can cause subtle runtime issues
- Build system configuration must align with TypeScript settings
- Development environment needs consistent module resolution

### Best Practices
- Use consistent import/export patterns across the codebase
- Implement strict type checking in build pipeline
- Maintain clear module boundaries
- Document module architecture decisions

### Technical Solutions
- Standardized module import/export syntax
