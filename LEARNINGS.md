Last Updated: 2025-07-06T11:09:57Z

## Backend

### Authentication Architecture
- Short-lived tokens enhance security in SSO systems
- OAuth2 integration requires careful client management
- Configurable token lifetimes support various use cases
- Rate limiting is essential for preventing abuse

- OAuth client storage requires careful schema design
- Activity logging needs balanced retention policies
- Migration strategies must consider OAuth data

### Security Implementation
- Rate limiting middleware protects sensitive endpoints
- Request logging aids in security monitoring
- Environment variable management is critical
- OAuth2 security requires thorough implementation
- Token validation must be consistently applied

### API Design
- Middleware composition improves code reuse
- OAuth2 endpoints need careful error handling
- Rate limiting should be configurable per route
- API documentation must stay current with changes
- Versioning strategy affects client compatibility

## Process

### Environment Management
- CRITICAL: Use the same database across environments
- Environment variables must be synchronized
- Production configurations need careful documentation
- Deployment platforms require specific setup
- Testing must cover all environment scenarios

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Remove outdated or deprecated content
- Use standardized timestamp format (ISO 8601)
- Maintain clear integration guides
- Document all environment requirements

### Version Control
- Semantic versioning guides package updates
- npm publishing requires organization scope
- Documentation must reflect version changes
- Release notes need comprehensive updates
- Version badges must stay current

### Development Workflow
