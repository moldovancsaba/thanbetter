# Development Learnings

## Backend

### JWT Implementation Insights
- Short-lived tokens are crucial for maintaining security in SSO systems
- In-memory token storage eliminates risks associated with persistent storage
- Rate limiting is essential to prevent token generation abuse
- Proper token invalidation strategy is key for security

### Security Considerations
- Implementing secure token transmission requires careful header management
- Regular token rotation helps maintain system security
- Rate limiting must balance security with user experience
- Memory-only storage requires robust error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Token validation should be optimized for minimal latency
- Caching strategies must consider security implications
- Database operations should be minimized for better performance
- Error handling needs to be both secure and informative

## Process
 
### Development Workflow
- Security-first approach leads to better system design
- Regular security audits should be part of the development cycle
- Documentation needs to be thorough yet maintainable
- Testing must cover both happy paths and edge cases

### Best Practices
- Keep tokens short-lived for enhanced security
- Implement proper rate limiting from the start
- Document security decisions and their rationale
- Regular security reviews are essential
- Maintain consistent TypeScript patterns across the codebase

### Development Standards
- Unified TypeScript implementation improves code maintainability
- Removing duplicate files reduces technical debt
- Standardized type definitions enhance development experience

## Additional Insights

### Frontend Development
- Utilize TailwindCSS for rapid responsive design
- Emphasize mobile-first UI components

### Testing Practices
- Implement integration tests for all critical paths
- Employ automated testing for regressions

### Team Collaboration
- Facilitate regular code reviews
- Encourage shared learnings across teams

### Deployment
- Use versioning strategies to track deployment results
- Ensure environment parity in development and production

## Continuing Education
- Attend workshops on security best practices
